As you already saw in the very first example though, `numpy` does this by smartly applying functions and operations to all elements in an array. At it's most basic level this will happen element-wise, as we saw previously. To demonstrate this again, we can simply multilply our `ones_matrix` by a scalar value and it will automatically do the right thing.

Of course, as you go into higher dimensions this intuition breaks down, but the key thing to keep in mind is to be careful which axes of your arrays you are operating on and being  diligent in making sure that your algorithms work as expected.
